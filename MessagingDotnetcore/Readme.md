<h2>Messaging with Dotnet Core Sample!</h2>

This sample contains the full code with comments here and there for each rpocess, it simply creates functions as Tasks to add to your Service Bus or Storage Account, where the login is declared as global variables for the project.

if you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me directly on Github and I'd be glad to answer!

PS: It has some Nuget packages so you should reimport them / restore them if they are not available in the project.

Happy coding!
